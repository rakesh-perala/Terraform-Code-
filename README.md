Here's a reusable and industry-acceptable format for setting up an Azure Front Door using Terraform. The code is divided into two main files: main.tf and variables.tf.




***************************************************** HowTo Use Code *****************************************

Reusability: By using variables, the Terraform code can be reused for different environments with minimal changes.
Industry Standards: The use of separate files for main logic and variables is a common practice, making the code easier to manage and understand.
Terraform Outputs: Outputs are defined to retrieve essential information after the deployment.
This structure allows for easy adjustments and scalability as your infrastructure grows.
